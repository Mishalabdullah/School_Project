Note for Gauthem:-

1. Work on the UI of the application (file name application.py). There are total of 18 boxes but only 9 are within the frame.
Please make all the boxes inside the frame and arrange the button according to your wish.


2. Create A Login Page and a database for the user creation.
	- database name : project
	- table name : users
3. Create a design for the whole app and theme it.(Preferably use blue as a main colour.)
